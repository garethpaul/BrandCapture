## Repository purpose

`garethpaul/BrandCapture` is an Apple platform application or Swift sample. An iOS App that automatically recognizes brands from your camera, while recording video or static images.

## Project structure

- `Makefile` - repository verification targets
- `scripts` - baseline checks and helper scripts
- `docs` - plans, notes, and generated README assets
- `Podfile` - CocoaPods dependency definition
- `BrandCapture.xcodeproj` - Xcode project
- `BrandCapture.xcworkspace` - Xcode workspace
- `BrandCapture` - repository source or sample assets

## Development commands

- Install dependencies: `pod install`
- Full baseline: `make check`
- Combined verification: `make verify`
- Lint/static checks: `make lint`
- Tests: `make test`
- Build: `make build`
- Local Apple development: `open BrandCapture.xcworkspace`
- If a command above skips because a platform toolchain is missing, verify on a machine with that SDK before claiming platform behavior is tested.

## Coding conventions

- Language mix noted in the README: C/C++ headers (2), Objective-C (2), Objective-C++ (2), C++ (1), shell (1).
- Use the CocoaPods workspace when present; update `Podfile.lock` only with an intentional dependency change.
- Preserve legacy Xcode project settings and signing assumptions unless the change is explicitly about modernization.

## Testing guidance

- No dedicated test files were detected; treat `make check` as the minimum baseline.
- Start with the narrowest relevant test or Make target, then run `make check` before handing off if the change is not documentation-only.
- Keep README verification notes in sync when commands, fixtures, or supported toolchains change.

## PR / change guidance

- Keep diffs focused on the requested repository and avoid unrelated modernization or formatting churn.
- Preserve public APIs, sample behavior, file formats, and documented environment variables unless the task explicitly changes them.
- Update tests, README notes, or docs/plans when behavior, security posture, or validation commands change.
- Call out skipped platform validation, legacy toolchain assumptions, and any risky files touched in the final summary.

## Safety and gotchas

- No required secret or credential file was identified in the repository scan. If you add integrations later, keep secrets out of git.
- This looks like an Apple platform project or sample. Xcode, Swift, CocoaPods, and deployment target versions may need to match the original project era.
- Capture controls mirror detector and camera state: Start is disabled while capture is active, and Stop remains disabled until capture is active.
- The capture-control storyboard outlets are wired so the state-sync helper reaches the Start, Stop, and toolbar controls.
- The preview image outlet is validated before camera setup so missing storyboard wiring leaves capture disabled.
- The grayscale conversion uses an explicit device-gray color space with one-channel bitmap info before handing frames to OpenCV.
- `Pods/` is vendored dependency code; do not hand-edit it unless intentionally updating dependencies.

## Agent workflow

1. Inspect the README, Makefile, manifests, and the files directly related to the request.
2. Make the smallest source or docs change that satisfies the task; avoid generated, vendored, or local-environment files unless required.
3. Run the narrowest useful validation first, then `make check` or the documented package/platform gate when available.
4. If a required SDK, service credential, or external runtime is unavailable, record the skipped command and why.
5. Summarize changed files, commands run, and remaining risks or follow-up validation.
